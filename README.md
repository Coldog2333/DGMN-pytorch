# DGMN-pytorch

An unofficial repository of the paper '**A Document-grounded Matching Network for Response Selection in Retrieval-based Chatbots**' [[paper]](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0756.pdf), which is implemented in PyTorch.

The codes have been tested on CMUDoG dataset with 1Ã—V100 GPU, training for 2h.
## Dependencies

+ Python 3.7
+ PyTorch 1.7.0
+ fitlog

## Datasets
You can download the datasets and their corresponding embedding tables used in their paper from the following links.
+ [PERSONA-CHAT](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gNyVL5pSMO6DnTIlA9ORNIrd2zm8f3QH) and its [embedding and vocabulary files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gGZfQ-m7EGo5Z1Ts93Ta8GPJpdIQqckC). <br>
+ [CMU_DoG](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GYKelOS9_yvc66fe9NqMnxWAwYAfoIzP/view?usp=sharing) and its [embedding and vocabulary files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vCm2shBE2ZxPI1Vw6bmCVv3xujVL72Xs/view?usp=sharing). <br>

Unzip the datasets to the folder of `dataset` and run the preprocessing codes provided in [JasonForjoy/FIRE](https://github.com/JasonForJoy/FIRE).

Then, you will obtain the preprocessing files in `dataset/personachat_preprocessed` and `dataset/cmudog_preprocessed`.

Also, we preprocessed the data in advanced, you can also simply run this command to download the preprocessed data:

```shell
sh download_dataset.sh
```

## Train
Temporarily we only test on CMUDoG. Here is an example to train DGMN in CMUDoG dataset.
```shell
sh run_cmudog.sh
```

## Acknowledgements
Thank Xueliang Zhao for providing the source codes written in TensorFlow for reference, it does help a lots.

## TODO
+ Evaluate on PersonaChat dataset.
+ Check why the reproduced version outperforms the reported result reported in the original paper.
